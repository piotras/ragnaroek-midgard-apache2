These are the installation instructions of the Midgard address
translation and user authentication module. The module is used by
Apache to map URLs to Midgard database records.

This module uses the GNU configure system for configuration and
installation. The configure script locates the Apache apxs tool and
uses it to compile and install the module. You can configure, build,
install and setup mod_midgard by running:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 # make install

The module needs midgard-core installed. If you build binaries for 
Linux distribution you should also install midgard-core development
package, which provides pc file used by pkg-config tool.

DEBIAN NOTE: 
This package should be configured with propper apxs binary 
( apxs2 in debian ).

 $ ./configure --wtih-apxs=/usr/bin/apxs2
